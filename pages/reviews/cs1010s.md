[[back]][back] [[Home]][home]

Taken in AY23/24 Semester I

Lecturer: Prof. Ashish & Prof. Adi

CS1010S is an introductory course to programming. Besides teaching you how to write a program in Python, this course helps you to train computational thinking, which would be beneficial to your future development.

This course contains major topics of functional abstraction, recursion & iteration, data abstraction, Abstract Data Structure (ADT), and Object-Oriented Programming.

If you are totally new to programming, this course would be quite hard. So it would be much more easier if you have watched MIT OpenCourseWare. You can self-study [MIT6.0001][mit] before the start of this course.
